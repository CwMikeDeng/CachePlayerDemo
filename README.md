# [ZPlayerCacher](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/ZPlayerCacher) ➡️

I have created a library called ZPlayerCacher that implements AVAssetResourceLoaderDelegate. This library can be easily installed and used in your project to enable caching of streaming files in AVPlayer. With ZPlayerCacher, you can optimize playback performance and reduce data usage without having to repeatedly download video content from the server.
